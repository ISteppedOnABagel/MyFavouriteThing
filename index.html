          It's no secret why I love him. He's charming, funny, and his character
          design is pretty awesome. I was kind of a hater on his new design but
          I guess it's not that bad. I just hate how the show, especially in the
          later seasons, has been underutilizing his character. He deserves more
          spotlight! He's literally one of the two main characters! Oh, poor cat
          noir...
